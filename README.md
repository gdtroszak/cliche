# cliché

A dead simple static site generator. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`


## Features

- All [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- File based routing
- Add an optional header and footer to all pages
- Add an optional stylesheet

Does that list seem short? Good. That's the idea. If it takes you longer to
figure out how to use this thing than it does to write your own SSG then I
failed.

No templating. No automatic aggregation of links on pages. No themes.

Based on the premise that curation is valuable, so you'll need to manually
organize and link your pages. It's really not that hard with a decent text
editor.

## Install

[Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) then run:

```
cargo install cliche  
```

## Usage

```bash
Usage: cliche [OPTIONS] <CONTENT>

Arguments:
  <CONTENT>  Directory containing the site's content

```

## Details

### Add a header file (optional)

```markdown
<!-- header.md -->

# my awesome website

<nav>

[home](contents/index.md)
[about](contents/about.md)
[whatever](contents/a/secret/path/whatever.md)

</nav>
```

### Add a footer file (optional)

```markdown
<!-- footer.md -->

[Contact](fake@gmail.com) | [Github](https://github.com/gdtroszak/cliche)
```

### Add some content

Create a directory for your content and add some files to it. Here's an example
that shows the URL paths to each page.

```bash
.
└── content/
    ├── index.md              // `/`
    ├── static/
    │   └── image.jpg         // `/static/image.jpg`
    ├── food/
    │   ├── index.md          // `/food`
    │   ├── coffee.md         // `/food/coffee.html`
    │   └── bread/
    │       ├── sourdough.md  // `/food/bread/sourdough.html`
    │       └── wheat.md      // `/food/bread/wheat.html`
    └── bikes/
        └── gravel.md         // `/bikes/gravel.html`
```

Maybe I'd want my homepage to link to a few other pages.

```markdown
<!-- content/index.md -->

- [food](./food/index.md)
- [gravel biking](content/bikes/gravel.md)
```

Note that links to other content can either be relative to the file itself or
the root of your project. Use a text editor with a Markdown LSP. It'll make this
really easy.

### Add some style (optional)

```css
/*style.css */

html {
    ...
}

body {
    ...
}
```

I'd recoomend that you just copy one of the many [classless](https://github.com/dbohdan/classless-css)
options available.

You can add classes by throwing a bunch of HTML all over your Markdown, but that
probably won't end well.

### Run it

```bash
cliche ./content
```

Your site should get spit out to a `_site` directory. If you took advantage
of using `index.md`'s to generate more canonical URL paths, you'll need to serve
the site. Something like [simple-http-server](https://github.com/TheWaWaR/simple-http-server)
is perfect for that.

```bash
simple-http-server -i --nocache ./_site
```
