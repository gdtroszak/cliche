# cliché

A dead simple static site generator. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`


## Features

- All [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- File based routing
- Add an optional header and footer to all pages
- Add an optional stylesheet

Does that list seem short? Good. That's the idea. If it takes you longer to
figure out how to use this thing than it does to write your own SSG then I
failed.

No templating. No automatic aggregation of links on pages. No themes.

Based on the premise that curation is valuable, so you'll need to manually
organize and link your pages. It's really not that hard with a decent text
editor.

## Install

[Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) then run:

```
cargo install cliche  
```

## Usage

```bash
Usage: cliche [OPTIONS] <CONTENT>

Arguments:
  <CONTENT>  Directory containing the site's content

Options:
      --header <HEADER>  Path to the site's header [default: header.md]
      --footer <FOOTER>  Path to the site's footer [default: footer.md]
      --style <STYLE>    Path to the site's stylesheet [default: style.css]
  -o, --output <OUTPUT>  Site output directory. Will be created if it doesn't already exist [default: _site]
  -h, --help             Print help
  -V, --version          Print version
```

## Details

### Add a header file (optional)

```markdown
<!-- header.md -->

# my awesome website

<nav>

[home](contents/index.md)
[about](contents/about.md)
[whatever](contents/a/secret/path/whatever.md)

</nav>
```

### Add a footer file (optional)

```markdown
<!-- footer.md -->

[Contact](fake@gmail.com) | [Github](https://github.com/gdtroszak/cliche)
```

### Add some content

Create a directory for your content and add some files to it. Here's an example
that shows the URL paths to each page.

```bash
.
└── content/
    ├── index.md              /
    ├── static/
    │   └── image.jpg         /static/image.jpg
    ├── food/
    │   ├── index.md          /food
    │   ├── coffee.md         /food/coffee.html
    │   └── bread/
    │       ├── sourdough.md  /food/bread/sourdough.html
    │       └── wheat.md      /food/bread/wheat.html
    └── bikes/
        └── gravel.md         /bikes/gravel.html
```

Maybe I'd want my homepage to link to a few other pages.

```markdown
<!-- content/index.md -->

---
title: my amazing website
meta_description: a website about me and all the things I like.
---

- [food](./food/index.md)
- [gravel biking](content/bikes/gravel.md)
```

A few things to note here:

1. You can optionally add a title and meta_description in front-matter. This
   will be used in the `meta` tags for the page.
2. Links to other content can either be relative to the file itself or
   the root of your project. Use a text editor with a Markdown LSP. It'll make this
   really easy.

### Add some style (optional)

```css
/*style.css */

html {
    ...
}

body {
    ...
}
```

I'd recommend that you just copy one of the many [classless](https://github.com/dbohdan/classless-css)
options available.

You can add classes by throwing a bunch of HTML all over your Markdown, but that
probably won't end well.

### Run it

```bash
cliche ./content
```

Your site should get spit out to a `_site` directory. If you took advantage
of using `index.md`'s to generate more canonical URL paths, you'll need to serve
the site. Something like [simple-http-server](https://github.com/TheWaWaR/simple-http-server)
is perfect for that.

```bash
simple-http-server -i --nocache ./_site
```

## GitHub Action

If you'd like to automate the generation and deployment of your site using GitHub Actions, you can use
the [cliche-action](https://github.com/gdtroszak/cliche-action). This action runs cliche and creates an
artifact that you can deploy to your prefered hosting provider. Here's an example workflow that deploys
a site to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

```yaml
name: deploy to pages
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  workflow_dispatch:
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false
jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: build site and upload artifact
        uses: gdtroszak/cliche-action@v1
      - name: setup pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      - name: deploy to gh pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
        with:
          artifact_name: cliche-site
```
